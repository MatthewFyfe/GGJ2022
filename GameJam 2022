theme: duality

ideas:

Playtime = 15-20 minutes

Karma - light and dark side of action board. Each is +2/-1 net value. If you pick a Light action another player gets to pick your Dark action and vice versa.

Use dice/cards/poker chips to keep basic board game assembly easy. Make action board.

Try to think of 4 actions per side?

Goal / winning: Have the most points. (first to 10?)
How to get points: Play poker hands. Play Actions that give points. Gather dice sets.

Each turn you pick a Karmic partner and choose an action. Payments go to partner. Track partner ala Catlantis with tokens, have to pick each person once then reset.

Start with 3 cards, 3 die, 3 chits each. Play cards on your turn, once placed they stay down. Roll dice immediately when received, they stay in play. Only hidden info is unplayed cards.

Points: 
  Poker hand - pair = 1 + 1 per extra
  Short Run (2) = 1 + 1 per extra
  Short Flush (3) = 1 + 1 per extra  XXX
  Dice set (2) = 1 + 1 per extra


Light Actions:
  Draw 2 Card / Give 1 die    = 1-strong, 2-middle
  Gain 1 Coin / Give 2 Chit    = 1-strong, 2-weak
  Roll 2 die / Give 1 card    = 1-strong, 2-middle
  Draw 1 Card + Roll 1 Die / Give 1 Chit    = 1-strong, 2-weak

Dark Actions:
  Steal 2 Card / Give 1 card+chit to player   = 1-strong, 2-weak
  Steal 3 Chit / They roll 1 die    = 1-weak, 2-strong
  Swap 1 die + draw 1 card / Pay 1 Card    = 1-middle, 2-middle
  Swap 1 card + roll 1 die / Pay 1 die    = 1-middle, 2-middle




Card Odds Math:
  Given flush A, useful card drawn: ~13/52
  Given straight X, useful card drawn: ~8/52
  Given pair Y, useful card drawn: ~3/52

  total use: 24/52
  total use no flush: 11/52

Dice Odds Math:
  Given set A, useful die rolled: 1/6




Balance Notes:
  -chits seem weak / useless so far
  -no flush seems to fix card/die balance
  -first player seems to have advantage... play our end of round seems to help

Test 1:
  - Kovolta went first, 0-1 initial score. Matt won. Close game with some back and forth and could have gone either way with luck. Steal 2 / Give 1 card action seemed strongest with no real penalty on light side. Generally good review.

Test 2:
  - What if karmic partner was always player to left?
  - What if restricted to one side (light or dark)?
  - try to simplify new player experience
  - Time to play seems to be 10 mins per player
  - Mike had early lead, ended in tie game with Matt


  Need turn token (active player)

Solo Tests:
  - Randy random can beat me sometimes


Test 3:
  - Dumping chits seemed strong, and forces unfun forced choice Dark 2
  - Duration felt reasonable
